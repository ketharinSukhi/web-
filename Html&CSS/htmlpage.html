A digital design can be described using a schematic drawing with pre-created building blocks that are equivalent to conventional standard parts, which can be compiled and then programmed directly into a target PLD with the added capability of easily simulating the design within the same development tool. 
<span class="sp">We believe that graduates will actually apply the concepts presented</span> in this book using higher-level description methods and more complex programmable devices.The major shift in the field is a greater need to understand the description methods, rather than focusing on the architecture of an actual device. Software tools have evolved to the point where there is little need for concern about the inner workings of the hardware but much more need to focus on what goes in, what comes out, and how the designer can describe what the device is supposed to do. 
We also believe that graduates will be involved with projects using state-of-the-art <a href="#">design tools and hardware solutions.</a>
